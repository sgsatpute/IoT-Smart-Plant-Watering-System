# IoT Smart Plant Watering System
An IoT-based automatic irrigation system that monitors real-time soil moisture using a sensor and controls a water pump through an ESP8266 NodeMCU. The system supports both automatic and manual control via the Blynk mobile app and sends alerts when moisture is low â€” helping to save water and reduce manual effort.
